#Reflection 

##Can I clearly track the development of my website through my commits?
- Yes, every two lines added is a new commit and they often relate to each other
##How effectively do the commit messages communicate what I was doing?
- I suppose one commit for every two lines isnt the most accurate tracking of my work, but I was writing everything by every two lines.
##How might I embed this process, or something similar in other places of my life?
- I could use a process like this to keep track of my digital music production
